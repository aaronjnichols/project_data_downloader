# üöÄ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying your API to production, make sure you've completed these steps:

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Preparation
- [ ] All API code committed to GitHub
- [ ] .gitignore properly excludes sensitive files and output directories
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys in code
- [ ] Updated contact URL in `api/main.py` with your GitHub repository

### Testing
- [ ] API starts successfully locally: `python start_api.py`
- [ ] All tests pass: `python test_api.py`
- [ ] Health endpoint responds: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- [ ] OpenAPI schema accessible: `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`

### Configuration
- [ ] Review `config/api.env.example` for environment variables
- [ ] Choose appropriate log level for production (warning/error)
- [ ] Consider rate limiting for public deployment

## üåê Deployment Steps

### 1. Choose Platform
- [ ] **Render** (recommended - free tier)
- [ ] **Railway** (easy deployment)
- [ ] **Fly.io** (global edge)
- [ ] **Docker** on any platform

### 2. Deploy API
- [ ] Create web service on chosen platform
- [ ] Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Set start command: `uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- [ ] Configure environment variables if needed
- [ ] Deploy and wait for build completion

### 3. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Health check works: `https://your-app.com/health`
- [ ] API docs accessible: `https://your-app.com/docs`
- [ ] OpenAPI schema works: `https://your-app.com/openapi.json`
- [ ] Test a simple API call

## ü§ñ Custom GPT Setup

### 1. Create GPT
- [ ] Go to ChatGPT ‚Üí My GPTs ‚Üí Create a GPT
- [ ] Set name: "Geospatial Data Assistant"
- [ ] Add description and instructions from deployment guide

### 2. Configure Actions
- [ ] In Actions tab, click "Create new action"
- [ ] Import from URL: `https://your-app.com/openapi.json`
- [ ] Set authentication to "None" (or configure if you added auth)
- [ ] Test the action works

### 3. Test GPT
- [ ] Try: "I need flood data for Miami, Florida"
- [ ] Try: "Get elevation data for Boulder, Colorado"
- [ ] Verify downloads work end-to-end

## üîí Security (Production)

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add API key authentication
- [ ] Configure CORS for specific domains
- [ ] Set up rate limiting
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Set up log aggregation

## üìä Monitoring

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor API health and response times
- [ ] Check error rates and failed downloads
- [ ] Monitor storage usage for job cleanup
- [ ] Set up alerts for API downtime

## üéâ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- [ ] GPT can list available data sources
- [ ] GPT can create and monitor download jobs
- [ ] GPT can provide working download links
- [ ] Users can successfully download and use GIS files
